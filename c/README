Overview
========

This is a project about counting constructible numbers.

See the README in the root project directory for more details.

Building
========

There's only one external dependency, and that's GMP. Install
according to your operating system. The makefile links this 
with the switch '-lgmp', adjust as necessary. 

This was successfully compiled and run on cygwin with gcc 7.3.0
and on native debian with gcc 5.3.1.

Description
===========

This README has some implementation notes on the c program.

The primary algorithm

The algorithm for finding constructible points is as follows:
1) Start with a set of points.
2) Iterate over every possible pair, and
3) construct a line, left circle, and right circle from the pair.
4) Iterate over every possible pair of objects in (3) and,
5) find the intersections.

This is a straight forward algorithm. The naive upper bound 
for n points is calculated with:
    b = 3 * n * (n - 1) / 2
    the upper bound is then: b * (b - 1)
    
See the file upper_bound.c for more details.

Implementation notes
====================

- constructible.c is the main file
- config settings are in global.h
- there are some static variables declared in point,line,circle;
this avoids mpf_init and mpf_clear in the method calls, but
makes those methods rather unsafe for threading.
- some tests are run to ensure accurcy, see test.c
- there is a sample file to ensure GMP is installed correctly,
see test_gmp.c
