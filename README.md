Constructible number count

This is a project about constructible numbers. Starting with a set of points, count the number of constrible points added after using only a ruler and compass. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constructible_number

**constructible_points.nb**

Mathematica notebook to apply ruler and compass construction to a set of points. All possible line-line, line-circle, and circle-circle intersections are generated.

**constructible_plot.nb**

Mathematica notebook to graph the lines and circles from the constructible points generated by {0,0} and {1,0}.
